Cube Helper is a package to make equalisation, concatenation, and analysis of 
[iris](https://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/)
cubes easier. It is written with reasearchers in mind and provides a good degree of
abstraction from many `iris` functions and methods.
 
The package is written entirely in Python, and provides a number of reusable methods.
